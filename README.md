# Restaurant Reviews
This project was built using MERN(MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js).

Some features of this project:
* View a list of restaurants
* Create reviews
* Edit reviews
* Delete reviews

The MERN version is in the branch `mern`

In order to work properly, you must run the server.js in the backend folder:

### `nodemon server`

In the folder frontend, you can run:

### `npm start`

## MongoDB Realm Version

There is also a version totally in the cloud, where the frontend and backend are all hosted in the MongoDB Realm.
